# Lab 04: Microcontrollers, Sensors, and Actuators

## What We Did in The Last Lab

In the previous lab, we delved into digital circuit design, starting with the creation of a 2 to 1 mux using fundamental logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT gates. Progressing further, a 74150 mux chip was utilized to construct a 4 to 1 mux, meticulously wiring based on comprehensive diagrams and documentation. Integrating Arduino, it was employed to control and test the mux's functionality, programming it to manage input data and control lines while validating output accuracy through systematic testing. Lastly, a 1-bit adder circuit was designed and implemented, showcasing proficiency in combining logic gates for arithmetic operations.
